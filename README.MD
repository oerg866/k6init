**K6INIT** is a driver for MS-DOS that lets you configure special features of AMD K6-2/2+/3/3+ processors, replacing tools like `k6dos.sys` and `setk6.exe`, and is similar to FASTVID on Pentium systems.

While **K6INIT** can run completely autonomously, it supports manual, detailed control over **Memory Type Range Registers** (including Write-Combine and Cachability modes), **Write Allocate**, **Write Ordering**, **CPU Cache** and **Frequency Multiplier**.

In contrast to other tools, **K6INIT** can be loaded from `CONFIG.SYS`, so it works
even with an extended memory manager (such as `EMM386`) installed.

If called with the `/auto` parameter, **K6INIT** does the following:

- *Write Ordering mode* to **1 (All except UC/WC)**
- *Write Allocate* for **all system memory** (auto detected)
- *Write Combining* for **Linear Frame Buffer(s) exposed by PCI/AGP graphics cards and VESA BIOS**
  (auto detected)
- *L1 Cache* to **Enabled**
- *L2 Cache* to **Enabled** (supported CPUs only!)
- *Data Prefetch* to **Enabled**

This can be altered and overridden with many command line parameters.

**K6INIT** runs on Chomper Extended (CXT) K6-2 chips or later.

**K6INIT** was built using the [LIB866D DOS Real-Mode Software Development Library](https://github.com/oerg866/lib866d)

# Running the Driver

Usage (config.sys):
`DEVICE=K6INIT.EXE <parameters>`

Usage (command line):
`K6INIT.EXE <parameters>`

All parameters are case-inensitive. Parameters other than `/auto` should only be used by knowledgeable users.

## Command Line Parameters

K6INIT offers several command-line options to configure and manage memory settings, CPU features, and other system parameters. Below is a detailed explanation of each parameter.

### `/?`
**Description:** Prints this list of parameters.

---
### `/status`
**Description:** Displays the current program status.

---
### `/quiet`
**Description:** Reduce text output, only print warnings/errors

---
### `/auto`
**Description:** Fully automated setup. It is equivalent to `/pci /lfb /wa:0 /wo:1 /l1:1 /l2:1 /prefetch:1`

Parts of this procedure can be disabled with the following `/skip` parameters.

---
### `/skippci`
**Description:** Skip PCI/AGP Frame Buffer Detection & MTRR Setup

---
### `/skiplfb`
**Description:** Skip VESA Linear Frame Buffer Detection & MTRR Setup

---
### `/skipcpu`
**Description:** Skip CPU internals setup (Cache, Prefetch)

---
### `/skipwawo`
**Description:** Skip Write Allocate / Order setup

The above `/skip` parameters should be used with /auto preceding them.

---
### `/chipset`
**Description:** Apply chipset-specific tweaks

***WARNING:*** Highly experimental feature!

Some chipsets support acceleration of frame buffer write cycles, which K6INIT can leverage.
See above for supported chipsets.

---
### `/mtrr:offset,size,wc,uc`
**Description:** Enables Write Combining for a specific memory range.
**Parameters:**
  - `offset`: Linear offset (e.g., `0xE0000000`)
  - `size`: Length in kilobytes (e.g., `8192`)
  - `wc`: Write-combine flag (`1` to enable, `0` to disable)
  - `uc`: Uncacheable flag (`1` to enable, `0` to disable)

**Notes:**
  - The `/mtrr` option can be used twice.
  - Discards any MTRRs configured before running the program.

---
### `/mtrrclr`
**Description:** Disables Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) entirely.

**Notes:**
  - Clears any existing MTRRs, including Write-Combined and Uncacheable regions.

---
### `/lfb`
**Description:** Automatically finds and enables Write Combining for the Linear Frame Buffers (LFB).

---
### `/pci`
**Description:** Automatically finds and enables Write Combining for Frame Buffers exposed by PCI / AGP graphics cards (experimental).

---
### `/vga`
**Description:** Enables Write Combining for the VGA memory region (`A0000-BFFFF`).

**Notes:**
  - **Warning:** This option is potentially unsafe. Do not use this memory region for Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs).
  - Equivalent to: `/wc:0xA0000,128,1,0`

---
### `/wa:size`
**Description:** Configures Write Allocate (WA) settings.

**Arguments:**
  - `size`: Memory size in kilobytes.

**Notes:**
  - Set this to `0` to disable Write Allocate.

---
### `/wahole:1/0`
**Description:** Forces 15-16 MB memory hole skipping for Write Allocate

**Notes:**
  - K6INIT usually detects the memory hole by itself, but this option can be used to force it on or off.

---
### `/wo:mode`
**Description:** Configures the Write Order Mode.

**Arguments:**
  - `mode`: A single digit representing the desired mode.
    - `0`: All memory regions (Slow)
    - `1`: All except uncacheable or write-combined regions (Fast)
    - `2`: No memory regions (Fastest)

---
### `/multi:x.y`
**Description:** Configures the CPU frequency multiplier.

**Arguments:**
  - `x`: Integral part of the multiplier.
  - `y`: Fractional part of the multiplier.

**Notes:**
  - Requires a K6-2+ or K6-III+ CPU.
  - Example usage: `/multi:5.5`

### `/l1:1/0`
**Description:** Enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) the Level 1 cache.

---
### `/l2:1/0`
**Description:** Enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) the Level 2 cache.

**Notes:**
  - Only K6-2+ and K6-III+ CPUs have an on-die L2 cache.

# Building **K6INIT**

## Required Build Environment

* MS-DOS 6.xx or 7.xx or Windows 95/98
* Microsoft C / C++ Compiler Version 7.00 with latest patch set

  ***or***
  Microsoft C / C++ 8.00 (comes with Visual C++ 1.52).

  In this case you need a 32-Bit DOS Extender such as HX-DOS or build on a modern windows machine.
* `LIB` and `INCLUDE` directories from the **DOS Internals** disk bundled with *Geoff Chappell's* excellent book of the same name
    Can be acquired here: https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/sw/books/dos_internals/

    I have requested permission from *Geoff Chappell* to bundle these files with the **K6INIT** repository, but have not yet received a response.
* Updates for the above libraries from *Geoff Chappell's* website: https://www.geoffchappell.com/notes/dos/internals/crtdrvr/update.htm?ta=8.714286804199219&tx=6
* DPMI host (not necessary on Windows)
  * I use HXDPMI32 ([part of HXDOS by Japheth](https://www.japheth.de/HX.html)).

*Note: Previous versions required the Microsoft Macro Assembler to build. As LIB866D includes macros that allow the usage of unsupported opcodes in inline assembly, this is no longer the case.*

## Building

```
cd <somewhere>\k6init
nmake
```

That's all.

### Debug build

To make a build with a lot of verbose debug output, build it with `DEBUG=1`:

```
nmake DEBUG=1
```

### Borland and Watcom Compiler support

While **Borland C/C++ 3.x**, **Borland Turbo C/C++ 3.0** and **OpenWatcom v2** are technically supported, the resulting executable will not be loadable in `CONFIG.SYS`. Use the following commands to compile them:

#### Borland Turbo C/C++:

`tcc -wall -g1 -Ilib866d -ek6init.exe lib866d\*.c k6init.c`

#### Borland C/C++:
`bcc -wall -g1 -Ilib866d -ek6init.exe lib866d\*.c k6init.c`

#### OpenWatcom:
`wcl -wcd111 -w9 -bt=dos -Ilib866d lib866d\*.c k6init.c`

## Build environment issues

I developed this on an AMD K6-II CXT 500MHz. DOS is not the most stable and easy to configure environment in the world and there are a few quirks to address.

### Weird errors when building

**USE HIMEM.SYS THAT COMES WITH MICROSOFT C/C++ 7.00!**

You'll get weird errors otherwise. It's something to do with XMS size. I can get this to compile with JemmEx when limiting its reported size to 32MiB.

QEMM '97 also works, but after a while I got really strange behavior. I cannot open K6init.h (and only that file) properly via network share anymore.

### Linker doesn't run when DPMI host is running

I couldn't really fix this, so I took the linker (`LINK.EXE` and `CVPACK.EXE`) from Microsoft Visual C++ 1.52. **NOTE:** The linker from VC1.52 requires a 32-Bit DOS Extender.
VC1.52 includes one in the form of `DOSXNT.EXE`

### CodeView doesn't run when DPMI host is running

No idea. I don't use the debugger (yet) so at the moment it is not a big deal for me but it would be cool to fix this...?

### Why don't you just use 386-MAX as suggested by Microsoft?

Because when I load it, it reboots my computer. %-)
